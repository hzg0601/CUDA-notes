# Image denoising using CUFFT

A parallel implementation for image denoising on a Nvidia GPU using [Cuda][cu] and the [cuFFT Library][df1]
The sofware:
  - Automatically selects the most powerful GPU (in case of a multi-GPU system)
  - Executes denoising
  - Saves output as text file and image

### Installation
The software requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/opencv-v2-4-2-released.html) v2.4.x to run.

Install the dependencies and compile the Makefile.

```sh
$ cd image-denoising-using-cufft
$ make
```
### Demo 
The software needs some parameters: 
  - Number of threads (per block, for each direction)
  - Path to the output *'.txt'* file. If the file does not exist, it's created.
  - Path to the input image
  - Path to the *'.txt'* containing the kernel. [NB kernel's size is fixed to 5x5]
 
You can run the software by typing
```sh
$ ./convolution <num_threads> <output_file_path> <image_path> <kernel_path>
```
